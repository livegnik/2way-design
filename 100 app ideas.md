## 100 App Ideas

<br>

### Introduction  

The 2WAY system is a decentralized identity and reputation platform that enables users to manage their digital presence securely. At the heart of 2WAY is its plugin architecture, which allows apps to function as independent modules while leveraging shared data and interacting with each other seamlessly.  

2WAY plugins act like apps that extend the system’s core functionality. Each plugin operates independently but can access and interact with system-wide data stored in the local database. Unlike traditional applications where data is confined within each app, 2WAY plugins share a unified data structure, allowing them to integrate with one another. This means a plugin designed for identity verification can seamlessly work with a marketplace plugin to establish trust between buyers and sellers.  

Every plugin communicates with the Graph Manager, which maintains the 2WAY Graph, a decentralized structure that organizes and connects user identities, entities or objects, trust scores, and access permissions. When a plugin requests data, the Graph Manager retrieves the relevant information based on the user’s degree of separation within the graph. This allows plugins to filter content dynamically depending on the user's connections and reputation.  


The Storage Manager acts as the primary interface between plugins and the local database. Whenever a plugin stores new data or updates existing records via the Graph Manager, the Storage Manager ensures the information is properly indexed and accessible for future queries. This allows different plugins to access and build upon each other’s data, reinforcing the collaborative nature of the 2WAY ecosystem.  

On the frontend, 2WAY plugins integrate directly into the user interface, providing new functionalities while maintaining a unified experience. When a plugin is installed, it registers its interface elements within the system, allowing users to interact with its features just as they would with any traditional application. Notifications and updates from plugins are consolidated into a single system-wide feed, preventing fragmentation of user experience.  

A social media plugin can fetch trust scores from the identity plugin to filter out spam. A marketplace plugin can use the reputation system to show only verified sellers. A peer-to-peer ride-sharing plugin can verify user credibility using existing network trust. This interoperability enables apps to work together in ways that centralized platforms cannot.  

The following 100 app ideas explore how 2WAY plugins can enhance commerce, communication, security, knowledge-sharing, and more. These ideas are grouped into ten categories, each highlighting a specific use case.  

With 2WAY, you’re not just building an app, you’re contributing to a self-reinforcing ecosystem where apps make each other smarter, safer, and more efficient.
