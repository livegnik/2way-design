# 2WAY

2WAY is a peer-to-peer alternative to the centralized Web. Instead of relying on remote servers and platforms, 2WAY runs entirely on your own machine. It replaces accounts, databases, and social graphs with a single lightweight graph-based structure. All data exists inside one composable, locally owned graph of Attributes, Parents, Edges, Ratings, and ACLs. Each node represents information such as a name, message, post, listing, or any other object. Every connection is cryptographically signed. Every interaction is filterable based on your own graph / network.

2WAY operates using a client-server model, but both parts run locally for most purposes. The backend manages the core logic: graph operations, access control, encryption, signatures, and peer-to-peer communication, optionally over Tor or other overlay network. The frontend consists of plugins, for the proof-of-concept, which act like self-contained apps. Each plugin interacts with the shared graph. A messaging plugin might display and send encrypted messages. A social plugin might show a feed of trusted updates. A marketplace plugin could list items and record ratings. Because everything is part of the same graph, stored in the same database, these plugins can share and reuse each otherâ€™s data without conversion, synchronization, or platform-specific APIs.

Unlike most decentralized systems, 2WAY does not aim for global consensus or a blockchain. There is no token, no ledger, and no central directory. Trust is subjective and personal, not objective and algorithmic. If you do not trust a user or plugin, their data will not appear in your local view. If you do, their graph merges into yours. This makes the system scalable, private, and human-centered. It works even when offline, and it adapts to each user's preferences without forcing one shared truth.

The repository includes two supporting documents. The first, `2WAY High-Level Design.md`, describes the architecture in more depth. It explains the core components, the flow of information, and how plugins integrate into the system. It covers the local-first nature of the graph and how data (identity, reputation, and communication) are handled without intermediaries. This design file is useful if you want to build (on top of) 2WAY or understand how it differs from other decentralized platforms.

The second file, `2WAY 100 app ideas.md`, is a brainstorming companion. It contains a curated list of practical use cases and plugin concepts that could be built using the system. These include things like decentralized marketplaces, collaborative editors, peer-to-peer funding tools, encrypted journals, or verified skill networks. The point is not just to list apps, but to demonstrate how the same graph and plugin model can support wildly different functionality within one system.

In 2WAY, every application is just a new view onto the same graph. You do not install a separate account or create a new identity for each tool. Everything is modular, interoperable, and controlled by the user. The system does not require permission to build, publish, or connect. It is a foundation for a new kind of internet where data is linked, not hosted, and trust is earned, not assigned.
